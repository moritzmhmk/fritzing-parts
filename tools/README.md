# Tools

## Schematic Generator

Can be used to generate simple (i.e. rectangular) svgs for schematic view ([open tool via rawgit](https://ghcdn.rawgit.org/moritzmhmk/fritzing-parts/react/tools/schematic_generator.html)).

## Circular mesh pattern Generator

Since patterns are not supported by `SVG Tiny` they need to be added in form of paths. This tool generates a circular grid that can be used as a mesh (e.g. in ultrasonic sensors).
